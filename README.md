#ARM Conveyor Belt Solution

This is sample test script for ARM's Conveyor Belt solution, written in Python. I had been asked for the solution in 2nd stage of Interview. The code requires some changes to run it correctly, please find & fix it before using it. This is sample for reference, always write your own code.
